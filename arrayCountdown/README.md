# Countdown

## Problem

The code in the code window attempts to run a launch-style countdown, from 9 to 0, but unfortunately encounters a runtime error. Fix the bug.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

Make the program first to see what happens ;)

{% endspoiler %}

{% next "Checks" %}

## Check Your Work

- Be sure to `make` your program
- Then run your program to ensure it does what it is supposed to do

{% next "Submit" %}

## Submit

Take a screenshot of the code with your username visible and paste in the Word doc in Teams.
