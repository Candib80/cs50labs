# Garbage Values

## Problem

In the below to the right, an array of 20 ints is declared, some values are set, and then the sum of the array is printed. However, the value printed seems to have little to do with the actual value of the sum. Why might this be? Fix the bug, to print the actual sum!

Ensure you read the comments and DON'T change the one line you are not supposed to. Instead, think about what some of the values of the array might be if we didn't tell the computer...
