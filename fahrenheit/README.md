## Turning Up the Heat

In the past, if you wanted to know what the outdoor temperature was, you had to look around for one of these, which might have been mounted outside at your house.

Prior to that, if you wanted to know what the temperature was outside, you just stood outside, but we digress. Nowadays, it’s a fairly trivial exercise to pull open a weather app on your phone or visit a weather-reporting website to get the current temperature and the five-day forecast. No need to mess around with one of the above circular dials or its tube-of-mercury cousin.

Depending on where you live in the world, your country uses one of two major temperature scales. If you live in the United States (and don’t spend most of your day working in a science lab), it’s likely that you’re familiar with the Fahrenheit scale, and so if you hear that it’s 30° outside you’re probably putting on a heavy coat and warm pants and bracing yourself for the possibility of snow, because that means it’s quite cold, given that the freezing point of water is 32°. On the other hand, it’s not until the temperature hits 212° that water boils.

In practically every other country of the world (or if you live in the United States and do in fact spend most of your day working in a science lab), you’re probably most familiar with the Celsius or centigrade scale. In that case, if you hear that it’s 30° outside you’re probably going to rummage through your closet for a swimsuit and put on some sunblock, because it’s a beautiful beach day. On the Celsius scale, 0° is the freezing point of water, and 100° is the boiling point.
