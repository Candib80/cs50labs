# Struct1

## Problem

* Create a structure named `vehicle` that holds as properties `brand`, `model`, and `miles`. Create those properties with an appropriate data type for each.  
* Then create an array to hold **3** `vehicle`s; this array can be named anything appropriate.  
* Get input from the user to propagate the array.
* Print the information of the **second** vehicle to the terminal.

{% spoiler "Hint" %}

* You will probably need to iterate over all the elements in the array to assign the user input to the properties
* *How do you iterate over an array??*
